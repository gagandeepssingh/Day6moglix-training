STATIC IMPORT -In Java, static import concept is introduced in 1.5 version. With the help of static import, we can access the static members of a class directly without class name or any object. For Example: we always use sqrt() method of Math class by using Math class i.e. Math.sqrt(), but by using static import we can access sqrt() method directly.According to SUN microSystem, it will improve the code readability and enhance coding. But according to the programming experts, it will lead to confusion and not good for programming. If there is no specific requirement then we should not go for static import.

Collections -ArrayList , Map,LinkedList etc 

We can use diffrent methods like map , filter using stream() i.e 

List<Employee> employeeList = new ArrayList<Employee>();
				employeeList.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getGender, Collectors.counting()));

ENUM---An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it. Common examples include compass directions (values of NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST) and the days of the week.

Because they are constants, the names of an enum type's fields are in uppercase letters.
